Looks like you resolved your conflict
and found our branch, congrats!! Well,
this branch seems to have a file which
was seen in another branch earlier. I
think this file has something to do
with the next clue, but it seems to be
very ugly looking. Maybe if we compare
this file with the file from before
we can understnd something...
