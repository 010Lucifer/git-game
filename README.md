Good job! You're almost done!! Excited??
Hope you are! You got one more thing to do!

Now its time to update this branch,
updating is really useful when you fork a
repository and your forked repo starts to
get behind on commits. The repository to
update from is: https://github.com/hgarc014/git-game-remote.git

Don't cheat!!
